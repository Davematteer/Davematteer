## Aspiring Tech Enthusiast | Computer Engineering Student @ Ashesi University
I'm a computer engineering student with a passion for technology and innovation. 
I'm a **mobile app developer** diving into **Flutter development** and exploring the exciting world of **blockchain technology**. 
I'm also delving into backend development with Java, but my ultimate goal is to pivot into full-stack development with JavaScript ðŸŒŸ. 
I love learning, experimenting, and building projects that solve real-world problems. Let's connect and create something amazing together! ðŸš€
